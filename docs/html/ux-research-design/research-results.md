# UX Research Results

## <a name="2020-research"></a>2020 Research Synthesis

Over the course of 2020, the pip team worked on improving pip's user experience, developing a better understanding of pip's UX challenges and opportunities, with a particular focus on pip's new dependency resolver. The [Simply Secure](https://simplysecure.org/) team focused on 4 key areas:

- [Understanding who uses pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8518)
- [Understanding how pip compares to other package managers, and supports other Python packaging tools](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8515)
- [Understanding how pip's functionality is used could be improved](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8516), and
- [Understanding how pip's documentation is used, and how it could be improved](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8517)

Some key outcomes from the 2020 work are:

- This documentation & resource section!
- A pip UX research panel ([Sign up here!](https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/pip-ux-studies.python.org/))
- New and expanded GitHub issues
- UX improvements in 2020
  - UX work supporting the dependency resolver
  - Improved error messaging
  - Supporting Documentation
- UX Training for the Pypa + pip maintainers

This work was made possible through the [pip donor funded roadmap](https://wiki.python.org/psf/Pip2020DonorFundedRoadmap).

### Research Methods

#### Outreach

We [recruited participants](https://www.ei8fdb.org/thoughts/2020/03/pip-ux-study-recruitment/) for a user research panel that we could contact when we wanted to run surveys and interviews about pip. In total 472 people signed up to the panel, although some unsubscribed during the research period.

At the end of the 2020 research, we asked users to opt-in to a [long-term panel](https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/pip-ux-studies.python.org/), where they can be contacted for future UX studies. Should the pip team wish to continue to build this panel, we recommend translating the sign-up form into multiple languages and better leveraging local communities and outreach groups (e.g. PyLadies) to increase the diversity of the participants.

#### User Interviews

In total, we **interviewed 48 pip users**, recruited from the user panel, and through social media channels.

During the interviews, we asked users about:

- How they use Python
- How long they have been using pip
- Whether or not they use a virtual environment
- If and how they address security issues associated with pip
- Which pip commands they regularly use
- How they install packages with pip
- Their experience using pip list, pip show and pip freeze
- Their experience using pip wheel
- Whether or not they use other package managers, and how pip compares to their experience with these other tools
- What the pip team could do to improve pip
- Problems they have experienced while using pip, and how they solved these problems
- Their perception and use of the pip documentation
- What other technical documentation they value, and how the pip docs could take inspiration from these
- What other resources the pip team could provide to help pip users solve their problems

#### <a name="survey-results"></a>Surveys

We **published 10 surveys** to gather feedback about pip's users and their preferences:

#### Research Results

Below is a compiled list of all research outputs and recommendations made by the pip UX team based on the research conducted in 2020.

We are currently looking for volunteers to take recommendations made by the UX team and move them into pip's issue tracker. This will ensure that the research conducted in 2020 is leveraged by the pip development team.
